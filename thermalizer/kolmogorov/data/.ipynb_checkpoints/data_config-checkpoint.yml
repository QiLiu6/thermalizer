reynolds: 5000       ## Reynolds number
trajectories: 20     ## Number of training trajectories per simulation
increment: 5         ## Number of numerical timesteps in a given emulator timestep
rollout: 5           ## Number of emulator timesteps to train over, i.e. the length of a training rollout
dt: 0.001            ## Numerical timestep for jax_cfd
spinup: 10000        ## How many numerical timesteps to run before storing snapshots, also known as spinup phase
decorr_steps: 1500   ## How many numerical timesteps to seperate training trajectories by
gridsize: 512        ## Simulation gridsize
downsample: 8        ## Downsampling factor for emulator fields
